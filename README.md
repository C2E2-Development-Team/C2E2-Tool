# C2E2 Verification Tool

Compare Execute Check Engine (C2E2) is a tool for verifying hybrid automata. Hybrid automata are models combining finite state machines and differential equations. They are used for modeling and analyzing robots, autonomous cars, medical devicesâ€”more generally, dynamical systems controlled by software. C2E2 can automatically check bounded time invariant properties of nonlinear hybrid automata. C2E2 (since ver 2.0, Sept 2018) supports compositional modeling, nonlinear dynamics, model editing, and has a powerful new plotter. Read more about the background theory here.
